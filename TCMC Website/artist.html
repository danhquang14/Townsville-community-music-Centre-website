          	<p>Poms from Oz are Judy, Kathleen and Alan Pomeroy, a family of solo vocalists from North Queensland, Australia. All are dinky di Oz with Judy and Kathy being descendants of First Fleeters. 
          	<br>
          	Their tight harmony and vocal strength bring a fresh feel to original, contemporary and traditional works, uncovering a rich tapestry of songs gathered in their travels from around the world. Most songs are a cappella but sometimes accompanied by guitar and/or harmonica. Moods in their songs range from downright to real tear jerkers and audience participation is encouraged. Their sound is distinctive, as Judy arranges all the songs specifically for their voices. 
          	<br>
          	A taste brew of Oz songs and Oz voices, with a dash of guitar and harmonica. Open a nice bottle of red, sit back and enjoy.

        	<p>The concept of the Camerata Singers originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell, who was teaching voice at James Cook University realized that ensemble singing was sadly lacking for tertiary music students. Since then, Susan, along with repetiteur Carol DallOsto, has strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community by performing at events from the Ingham Italian Festival through to Cotters Markets in the mall. 
        	<br>
        	The Camerata Singers comprises a group of trained singers, both male and female, from age 18 and over who strive to provide quality performances in a range of styles from classical through to A cappella and contemporary. A number of members also regularly participate in local music theatre and theatre productions.
